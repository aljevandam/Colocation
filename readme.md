# Colocation

## About 
This repo contains the code and notebooks accompanying the paper 'An information-theoretic approach to the analysis of location and co-location patterns' (van Dam etal., 2022).  

## Contents

- CoLoc_class.py: enables the user to analyze (co-)location patterns in Python, using the measures proposed in the paper. 
- Tutorial.ipynb: shows how to use the CoLoc class  
- Make_figures.ipynb: reproduces all figures presented in main text of the paper 
- Numerical_comparison.ipynb: reproduces figures in Appendix B.1 and B.3 of the paper 
- Test_priors.ipynb: reproduces figures in Appendix B.2 of the paper 
- BLS2016_clean.csv: data used for analyses in paper 
- tutorial_data.csv: data used in tutorial notebook

## Todo

- efficient computation of stdMIpij and KLpj_i 
- adjust make_rca so it can handle arrays 
- enable user to choose prior weight by providing percentage as input 
- make available as package 
- fix reference below
